## About

> Technology continues to evolve everyday at a rapid pace and trying to keep up with all these changes is a challenge we all face.

When I first started coding I tried to remember everything which only got me so far. Then the internet community got better at sharing information which got me to another level. Google got better at gathering and sorting this information which got me to another level. As I am getting older my memory is not as efficient as it once used to be so I began creating my own documentation to try and keep up with all these changes. Again this only got me so far because the information quickly becomes like **spaghetti bolognaise in the hands of a child**. 

Struggling with all these challenges I decided to start automating everything I could. This meant that I could also apply principles like **`KISS`** and **`DRY`** while taking a **`CONTINOUS DEVELOPMENT`** approach. So **anything that can be automated should be** and after doing this for a while this collection of scripts was being used in every project.

At one point I noticed that I had several projects with these collection of scripts except they all had different versions. That is when I decided to create Kali-Core so I could fork this git repository in accordance with the **`KISS`** and **`DRY`** principles. 

Kali-Core is what I use to quickly build any project that uses the command line interface as it provides some very useful scripts.
